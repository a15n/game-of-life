			The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite 2D orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead.
		</p>
		<p>
			Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
		</p>
		<p>
			At each step in time (generation), the following transitions occur:
			<ul>
				<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under population</li>
				<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation</li>
				<li>Any live cell with more than three neighbors dies as if by overcrowding</li>
				<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction</li>
			</ul>
